The Finnic Republic is a country of pirates that own a small number of islands, which have little agricultural value but lots of volcanos. These islands have shipyards they use to build boats or keep residence on,  though a proper Finnan is only truly home at sea. They have close relations with the sea folk, and their boats are often blackened from their heavy use of dark, fireproofed wood. Every five years, they gather as many boats as they can in a single location and vote on a new president. Their primary business is in pirating, and they hunt in packs. Their silent efficiency is widely-known, and sometimes they can board a ship, steal some cargo, and leave without anybody being the wiser. It is commonly-known that there are straights in the ocean, many by Hafen but some in the other areas as well, that if you want to pass you have to pay.

Finnans are probably most adjusted to the weirdness of Hafen out of all non-Hafens, due to their common trading relationships with them, though most Finnans care extends to quality of Hafen whorehouses, bars, and casinos, which are widely-considered the best in the world.

While the Finnic sea folk are not big fans of the necromancy Hafen practises, or the quality of the water by Hafen (due to ocean waste dumping), they understand how useful the alliance with Hafen is for Finna and so their aid to Hafen is assured.
